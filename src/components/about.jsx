      <p className="about-text">
        I'm a front-end developer who focuses on fast, reliable problem-solving. I specialise in debugging,
        UI fixes, small custom tools, and turning messy code into clean, maintainable solutions.
      </p>

      <p className="about-text">
        I work best on practical, focused tasks: bug fixes, UI adjustments, feature tweaks, code cleanup,
        small scripts, and self-contained tools built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript or React.
      </p>

      <p className="about-text">
        Every job comes with clear communication, fast response times, and code that’s easy to understand and extend.
